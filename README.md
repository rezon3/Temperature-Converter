# Temperature-Converter

*This is my first project on GitHub*

This project is a simple, VB.NET temperature converter that allows you to convert temperatures between:

- Celsius
- Fahrenheit
- Kelvin
- Rankine

Hope you enjoy! Feel free to leave me some pointers as I am new to software development.
